Objectives:
➢ Identify the functions of the Integumentary System.

		Main role is protection. Physical barrier that cover all of body, is watertight, acid buffer for bacteria, blood reserve, sythesize vitamin D, protect from UV radiation, hard keratinocytes and water resistant glycolipids as well as tight junctions. Dendritic cells in the epidermis as well as dermal macrophages.
➢ Describe the layers of the skin and relate their histological structure to their functions.

		Hypodermis, adipose and areolar, cushioning and allowing movement. Papillary dermis areolar and collagen/elastic fiber allowing for phagocytes to wander and look for bavteria that have broken the skin. Reticular dermis is dense irregular connective tissue and bundles of collagen. These collagen fibers give the skin strength an resiliency. The epidermis is mostly made up of keratinocytes. These produce keratic which gives the epidermis its protective properties. 
➢ Identify the sublayers of the epidermis.
➢ Discuss the factors that control skin color.
➢ Explain the role of sebaceous glands and sweat glands to the function of the
integumentary system.
➢ Summarize the characteristics of the 3 major types of skin cancers.

		Basal, most common least metastatic, smooth shiny nodule. Squamous, next common, metastatic, scaly red lesion. Melanoma, least common most deadly, brown/black patch.
➢ Explain why serious burns are life threatening and how the 3 types are classified.
