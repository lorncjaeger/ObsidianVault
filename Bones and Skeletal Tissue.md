Objectives:
• Describe the function of the skeleton and of bone tissue.
• Classify bones based on shape and identify examples of each.
• Describe the anatomy of bone tissue, including cells, tissue
types, functions, and chemicals stored within.

		
• Compare and contrast the types of bone ossification.
• Identify how and why bones remodel.
• Describe the steps to bone repair and healing.
• Discuss homeostatic imbalances of the skeletal system.

Intramembranous Ossification

		This is how the cranial portions of the skull are formed and the clavicles. In this kind of ossifcation bone is formed from fibrous connective tissue membrane. An ossification center is formed from mesenchymal cells clustering and differentiating into osteoblasts. These osteoblasts secrete osteoid which calcifies, then trapped osteoblasts become osteocytes. A honeycomb of immature spongy bone is formed and vascular mesencymal tissue condenses on the face of the bone and becomes the periosteum. Trabaculae just deep to the periostuem are remodeled and replaced with compact bone and immature spongy bone in the center is remodeled into mature spongy bone and filled with red marrow.

Endochondral Ossification

		Around the second month of development of a fetus, our bones are hyaline cartilage that acts as a template for the bone construction to follow. This is how almost all bones outside of the axial skeleton are formed.
